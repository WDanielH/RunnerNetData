| Run Name | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The Mummified Finger | One of three technomancers hired for the job, which required the team to steal a relic on display in St. James' Cathedral, ideally without anyone knowing that it had been stolen.<br /><br />The Big Bad Wolf himself disabled sensors that would have detected the weapons and smoke grenades being smuggled into the cathedral. He also locked certain external doors to influence the panicked congregation to flee in a certain direction and delay the arrival of unwanted reinforcements. |
| Radical Redmond | Protect a nova hot Matrix star while they record themselves going around the Redmond barrens.<br /><br />The Big Bad Wolf found out the star's name was Radical Richard and that his modus operandi was to start trouble in 'bad' parts of town and record what happens next. The team successfully prevented Richard from running into the most territorial gang's turf but did have to defend him from a junkie he antagonised. Tempers flared when a kid hacked one of Richard's camera drones and the star wanted to kill him in retribution. |
| The Mummified Finger 2: Penitent Boogaloo | One of only two runners who took the opportunity to atone for their actions in The Mummified Finger by getting one of the cathedral's security templars out of prison.<br /><br />Between them, the two runners found out which attorney was assigned to the templar's case and blackmailed her, resulting in the templar's freedom. |
| The Oncoming Storm | A big job to recover a kidnapped runner.<br /><br />The Big Bad Wolf found out via camera feeds that the runner had been taken to a Knight Errant precinct. He contacted his demolitions expert to procure breaching charges for those runners who would be entering the building. Meanwhile, he assisted the Matrix overwatch team by keeping an eye out for threats in meatspace while his sprite Code_Has_Eyes went into the building's host to prevent it from spawning IC. |
